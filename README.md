# Algorithm Implementations and Data Analyses

In this repository you will find some algorithms that I have coded, along with some analyses I have done.

Currently included in the repo:

  - Predictive modeling of customer churn data for a ride-sharing company ([link](https://github.com/joelcarlson/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/Churn_Predictions))
  - An object-oriented implementation of the KMeans unsupervised learning algorithm ([link](https://github.com/joelcarlson/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/KMeans_Implementation))
  - An object-oriented implementation of the K-nearest neighbors supervised learning algorithm  
    - Also included: an ad-hoc k-fold cross validation function ([link](https://github.com/joelcarlson/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/KNearestNeighbors_Implementation))
