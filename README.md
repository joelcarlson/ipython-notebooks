# Algorithm Implementations and Data Analyses

In this repository you will find some algorithms that I have implemented in Python, along with some analyses I have done.

Currently included in the repo:

  - Predictive modeling of customer churn data for a ride-sharing company / [link](https://github.com/joelcarlson/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/Churn_Predictions)
  - An object-oriented implementation of the KMeans clustering unsupervised learning algorithm / [link](https://github.com/joelcarlson/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/KMeans_Implementation)
  - An object-oriented implementation of the K-nearest neighbors supervised learning algorithm / ([link](https://github.com/joelcarlson/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/KNearestNeighbors_Implementation)
    - Also included: an ad-hoc k-fold cross validation function
  - A version of the (Nobel prize winning) residency match algorithm modified for the situation in which only one side submits ranks / [link](https://github.com/joelcarlson/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/ResidencyMatch_Implementation)
