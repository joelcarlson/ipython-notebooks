### One Sided Implementation of the Residency Match Algorithm

Contained in this repo is an implementation of the residency match algorithm with a simple modification: only the "residents" (students) match the "hospitals" (companies).

This was inspired by a simple problem encountered at the Galvanize bootcamp:

The students wish to interview with a number of companies, and each student has different preferences for the companies they wish to speak with. Thus, each student will rank each company in order of preference. 

The companies do not have access to the students they will interview, which is a departure from the residency match algorithm (in which hospitals and residents both rank each other).
